Use the following steps to set this up.

 - Click on **Storage Accounts** in the left navigation bar, then click **+ Add**
 - Give your storage a **Name**, and then select **Blob Storage** under **Account Kind**
 - Select your preferred replication method
 - Make sure you select **Enabled** on **Secure transfer required**
 - Select you existing **Resource Group**
 - Click **Create**
 - This will now create a new **Blob Storage** for your Azure Account
 - Once it is created, click on the created instance, and then click on **Access Keys**
 - Make sure you save the first key in your Text editor.
