To upgrade the server version running in your AWS elastic beantalk environment, do the following.
 - Update your Docker deployment file - Within your local machine, update the file called ```Dockerrun.aws.json```. You'll want to change the Image Name field. Leave everything else the same unless you intend to change it. Change out "latest" for the server version you want to run.

    **Dockerrun.aws.json**

    ```json
    {
      "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": "1",
      "Authentication": {
        "Bucket": "elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-385952297805",
        "Key": "formio.dockercfg"
      },
      "Image": {
        "Name": "formio/formio-enterprise:6.0.7",
        "Update": "true"
      },
      "Ports": [
        {
          "ContainerPort": "80"
        }
      ],
      "Logging": "/var/log/nodejs"
    }
    ```

  - Next, in Elastic Beanstalk go to Application versions and click the Upload button.

  - By convention enter the server version number in the Version label (i.e. 5.5.0) that matches the server version in the Dockerrun.aws.json file. Then upload the Dockerrun.aws.json file and click "Upload".

  - Finally, select the checkbox next to your new version (5.5.0 in this example) and select the Deploy button. Select the environment you want to deploy to and press the Deploy button.

Elastic Beanstalk will now deploy the new server version to your environment. You can roll back to a previous version by selecting it and clicking Deploy again.
