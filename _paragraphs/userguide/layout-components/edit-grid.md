**Edit Grids** allow users to replicate an table like structure when it comes to the capture and display of form data.
Users can add multiple components inside of the **Edit Grid**. Additionally, any number of grids can be added
within a form which is especially useful when needing the ability to add or duplicate multiple fields sets.

From the **Data** component menu, add the **Edit Gird (Array)** to any active form. By default the grid is empty 
but can have other form components placed inside.

The example below illustrates three **Basic Components** placed inside of a **Edit Gird (Array)**. Layout components
can be used to replicate the split view below, and additional rows are added automatically when additional form elements
are dragged into the interface.

As Entries are added the table displays the data below each respective header independent of the form layout.

&nbsp;

The form layout is displayed when ```Add Another``` is pressed, and the form appears below the grid for user entry.

Once submitted, form data can be viewed and edit via traditional platform methods.
