To assign group access, you need to include a Group Select or Resource component in the Form where you would like to grant group access.

![](/assets/img/groupselect1.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

`Note: You can hide this field during the form render if desired.`

Once the Group resource has been attached to the form, the access settings for the form must be updated. In the form access page, use the `Submission Resource Access` panel to select your group component.

![](/assets/img/groupselect2.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Once the Access is configured you may add group permissions to any new or existing submission to the form, by selecting the group which should have access (Enabling multiple will also work for multiple groups).
